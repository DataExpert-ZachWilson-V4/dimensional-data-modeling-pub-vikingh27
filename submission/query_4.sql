-- This query inserts actor data into the vpsjul8468082.actors_history_scd table.
-- It uses a Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) approach to track changes in actors' quality_class and active status over time.
-- The query identifies changes in status, computes streaks of consecutive years with the same status, and records the start and end dates for each streak.
