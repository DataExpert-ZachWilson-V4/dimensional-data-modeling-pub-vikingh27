-- This query inserts actor data into the vpsjul8468082.actors_history_scd table.
-- It compares the current year's data with the previous year's data to identify changes in the quality_class and active status.
-- The query generates rows for changes, keeping track of start and end dates, and creates new rows for the current year if changes are detected.
-- The result is inserted into the actors_history_scd table.
